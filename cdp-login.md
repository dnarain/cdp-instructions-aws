# Log In, Accept Terms, Add New Users

You would have received a welcome email from Cloudera with a link to CDP.  By
default CDP uses to my.cloudera.com for Single Sign On, which means:
* You can use your Cloudera support login to login to CDP
* If any user wants to connect to your CDP, all they need to do is self-register
on my.cloudera.com

Of course, in a production deployment you can cut this link and connect CDP to your any SAML-based corporate identity provider (instructions [here](https://docs.cloudera.com/management-console/cloud/user-management/topics/mc-configuring-your-enterprise-idp-to-work-with-cdp-as-a-service-provider.html))


On first login, you also may need to accept terms - which you can also find 
[here](https://www.cloudera.com/terms-conditions/).
